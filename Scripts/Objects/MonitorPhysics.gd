# Bruh.. was this script even needed? I made it cuz this node is what other nodes collide with.. I just wanted to put the monitor body and collision inside a
# seperate node that is a child of the monitor node itself and make the item icon a child to the monitor body till it gets reparented to the monitor node itself,
# so that the icon doesn't inherit its position from other nodes..

# It just calls the destroy() function from the parent node. (Yeah, I'm too lazy to move the parent destroy() function, and worried as well lol..)
